  - [x] Selecting a sort option should result in a reordering based on the selected sort while maintaining a grid view.

### Walkthrough Video

`TODO://` Add the embedded URL code to your animated app walkthrough below, `ADD_EMBEDDED_CODE_HERE`. Make sure the video actually renders and is playable when viewing this README. Ensure your walkthrough showcases the presence and/or functionality of all features you implemented above (check them off as you film!). Pay attention to any **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS** checkboxes listed above to ensure graders see the full functionality of your website!

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the labs were instrumental in helping me understand the project better, as much of it involved replicating and refining similar tasks. However, I felt somewhat unprepared for the shuffle feature, as it required external concepts like the Fisher-Yates algorithm.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
With more time, I would have enhanced the styling of my website and explored additional features beyond those outlined in the project. Specifically, I wanted to implement a proper navigation bar with options to create new playlists and sort them. Additionally, I aimed to include the ability to upload images when creating playlists.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The demo went well overall, but I noticed that many peers had impressive styling. I plan to reach out to them to learn as much as I can and apply those techniques in my future projects.
